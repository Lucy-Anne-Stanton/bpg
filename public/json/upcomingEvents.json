From here it's just a short walk to the harbourside, Temple Meads, Broadmead, Bedminster and Park Street.</p> <p>As usual the challenge involves:</p> <p>5 topics / 2 hours.  You can use any camera you like - mobile phone, iPad, DSLR, film, compact. The challenge is to capture something as interesting and unique as possible.  That could be, for example, an alternative angle, a different perspective or viewpoint, a close up, vibrant colour or unusual detail. Be creative.</p> <p>1.  Themes will be given out on the day by your event hosts at 11am and posted on the meetup site at this time</p> <p>2.  You have up to 2 hours to photograph the themes, shooting as many different versions and options as you like</p> <p>3.  Upload 5 final images : 1 for each theme only - feel free to put the rest on our Flickr site so everyone can see more of your work</p> <p>4.  Take time to look and comment on other members' images - and let them know what you like about their shot(s)</p> ",
