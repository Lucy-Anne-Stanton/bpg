    "description": "<p>First challenge of the new year ... and we are going back to black &amp; white!</p> <p>The aim of this challenge will be to produce 5 black and white images based on the topics. The topics themselves will be structured to make the most of the black and white theme. We'll also be including a worksheet which we hope will help.</p> <p>There are a couple ways to produce black and white images : the simplest way can be to convert in post-production. There are many programmes and apps out there that can do this for you - and it may be that your camera has a built-in black and white editing filter already, which you can use after taking the shot. There will be full details on how to do this in your manual. </p> <p>Another way is to set up \"in camera\", so you set your camera to shoot in black and white. If you are not sure how to do this, either check your manual or speak to one of us before the challenge starts, so we can help show you the settings - please bring your manual, in case we need to check it! If you can't find your manual, check online for a free download version. There are many guides to setting up cameras available, a quick Google search is sure to help.</p> <p>If you feel you want to do a bit of background reading about black and white photography, there are some great blogs out there. </p> <p>We think it will be fun to try something different, but it's not a necessity. Just come along to the Challenge and leave your shots as they are. </p> <p>As for the challenge, as usual :</p> <p><br/>5 topics / 2 hours.  You can use any camera you like - mobile phone, iPad, DSLR, film, compact. The challenge is to capture something as interesting and unique as possible.  That could be, for example, an alternative angle, a different perspective or viewpoint, a close up, vibrant colour or unusual detail. Be creative.</p> <p>1.  Themes will be given out on the day by your event hosts at 11am and posted on the meetup site at this time</p> <p>2.  You have up to 2 hours to photograph the themes, shooting as many different versions and options as you like</p> <p>3.  Upload 5 final images : 1 for each theme only - feel free to put the rest on our Flickr site so everyone can see more of your work</p> <p>4.  Take time to look and comment on other members' images - and let them know what you like about their shot(s)</p> ",
